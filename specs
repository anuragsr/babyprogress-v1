We have a website intended for medical professionals and patients. 

We have a website in html/css/js and we would like its forms to be registered in a dedicated database to which only the site administrators will have access. A summary of each form will be sent to a specific email address. We also want our site to be available in several languages. 

We want our site to be displayed in the user's navigatorâ€™s language, if his language is not available, the site will be displayed by default in English (en-us). We want to be able to add languages as we go along. To do this, we want each block of text (paragraph, title, button...) to be indexed in a spreadsheet, with the initial elements in the left column and their translations into the different languages on the right (one column per language). To add a new language, we would add a new column in the spreadsheet and fill the boxes with translations of the new language. 
Furthermore, we want the choice of languages to be displayed on all pages with small flags that would change the language if clicked. Three flags are displayed: English, French and Spanish, followed by a drop-down list to select the languages that are not displayed. 

Currently we have a website in french, we would like you to: 
-make the forms submit to a database 
-make it so that when a form is submitted, a summary is sent to a specific email address 
-give us the ability to translate the site in other languages from a spreadsheet
