        "section3Ques12": "What is the best date to perform a SIM37 ?",
        "section3Ans1": "No, SIM37 is a simple mathematical calculation made from an authorized and harmless MRI medical imaging for you and your baby. MRI does not emit X-rays (unlike CT or X-ray).",
        "section3Ans2": "The ultrasound at the end of pregnancy does not allow to see correctly the dimensions and the geometry of the skull of your child because the small pelvis bones interferes with the passage of the ultrasounds.",
        "section3Ans3": "The scanner is an examination intended to see the bone only, and can not be repeated without risk because it is a radiating examination using X-rays. The MRI makes it possible to see the soft tissues as well as the bone, and is therefore more appropriate than the scanner or ultrasound to see the dimensions and shape of the birth canal. Only the MRI makes it possible to perform a SIM37 test.",
        "section3Ans4": "The pelvimetry, whether done by scanner or standard radiography, only allows to see if the size of your pelvis is normal or not compared to the general population. Some women with a small pelvis give birth very well, while others with a large pelvis can not give birth. It all depends on the size and geometry of your baby's head. The question is whether YOUR child is in YOUR pool. Unfortunately pelvimetry does not answer this question.",
        "section3Ans5": "The optimal term for a delivery simulation is 37 weeks of amenorrhea. This examination can nevertheless be performed at any time between 36 SA and 41 SA, but the later it is programmed in pregnancy, the greater the risk of returning to work before being able to take the test.",
        "section3Ans6": "Just call 0145007812 between 10am and 6pm.",
        "section3Ans7": "You must talk to the health professional following your pregnancy. Any doctor (general practitioner, gynecologist, obstetrician) or midwife may prescribe this examination. In case of difficulties, you can contact our team on 0145007812.",
        "section3Ans8": "The SIM37 exam is currently available in 4 MRI centers in Paris. You can get an appointment closer to you by calling 0145 007812 between 10h and 18h",
        "section3Ans9": "SIM37 allows you to be informed, for each week that separates you from childbirth, of the biomechanical difficulties that may arise due to the growth of your child, while the dimensions of your pool remain the same. SIM37 allows you to choose the delivery route with the health professional who follows you. SIM37 can reduce the rate of emergency caesarean section, the number of unnecessary cesarean sections, and the number of traumatic deliveries. By reducing the number of emergency conditions and associated morbidity, SIM37 improves the birth experience for 90% of parents.",
        "section3Ans10": "SIM37 can not predict when a delivery will start. That's why the information is given for each week until the end (a bit like a weather forecast). SIM37 is not validated to know if a delivery by the seat is going to happen well. SIM37 does not yet assess the risks of tearing the perineum (expected version in 2019). SIM37 is not validated for deliveries of twin or multiple pregnancies. SIM37 is not suitable for prematurity.",
        "section3Ans11": "SIM37 is not yet reimbursed because it is a brand new innovation and we must wait for an evaluation of the service rendered to take place through a medico-economic study. We will keep you informed as soon as a refund is obtained. In the meantime, you can buy SIM37 from 30 Euros per month.",
        "section3Ans12": "SIM37 is optimal when performed at 37 weeks of amenorrhea."
